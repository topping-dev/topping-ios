Apple's documentation for this property states that it is NO by default, unless the object is a
UIKit control, in which case it is YES by default. UITextField is a subclass of UIControl, but its
default value for this property (on devices specifically, not simulators) appears to be NO.
MDCBaseTextField does not change UITextField's default value for this property. This means that on
MDCBaseTextField this property is by default NO as well. It also means that the text field behaves
more like an accessibility container, where every accessible thing within it is an accessibility
element.

Setting this property explicitly to YES on MDCBaseTextField results in the entire MDCBaseTextField
being treated as one accessibility element, as opposed to a container. When this happens,
@c accessibilityLabel will be treated as a computed property if it has not been explicitly set. The
value returned will be a concatenation of the elements contained within the text field. If @c
isAccessibilityElement has been set to YES, and @c accessibilityLabel has also been set, then the
assigned value of @c accessibilityLabel will be used for the entire text field. Explicitly setting
this property to NO (as opposed to leaving it as NO to begin with) causes VoiceOver to completely
ignore the text field, so that is not recommended.

 be used as the entire text field's accessibility label. If you explicitly set @c
 isAccessibilityElement to YES, but not @c accessibilityLabel, then @c accessibilityLabel will
 return a computed value that is a concatenation of the elements contained within the text field.
